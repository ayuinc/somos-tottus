## Angular Questions: 

- Dynamic navigation (assign visibility and permission to certain buttons as well as its actions/functions. Assign correspondent text or title according to the "state route" or "view")
- Dynamic background assignment
- User profile update (we need specific forms for each field/input that are going to be loaded into a sub-view. What would be the best approach?)
- Make the modal load faster
